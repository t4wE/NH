            He has many years of experience working in specially protected natural areas of Russia and abroad.
            He specializes in aquatic and wetland systems, their functions for maintaining climatic and hydrological balance, and their importance for the settlement of animals and plants.
            Here you can further highlight my quote (in italics or in some thin frame):
            "If we want to develop specially protected natural areas, then this necessarily requires a synthesis of a variety of activities. We need multifaceted scientific research, security visits, information exchange with local civil society activists, student and volunteer practices, and economic incentives. Each of these blocks, with active development and motivation, is able to improve the quality of nature conservation both in protected areas and beyond. We are trying to build such "bridges" for various public and expert groups in order to ensure high-quality and reliable protection of the most important ecosystems.

        He deals with the issues of faunistics, distribution and ecology of bats in the north-west of Russia. He pays special attention to the migration of bats and the remote study of bats using acoustic measurements with special ultrasound detectors.
        Quote: Bats are not only useful as insectivorous animals that eat a huge number of insects, including bloodsucking and pests of agriculture and forestry, but also as bioindicators, they mark with their presence "good" habitats for life, nutrition and breeding, and in general are an important element of ecosystems. The preservation and study of these amazing animals are two simple reasons for my activity.
