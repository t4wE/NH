        The creation of specially protected natural areas is the most effective way to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment. An extensive network of specially protected natural areas (protected areas) has been created in Russia, with a rich history and invaluable potential. Of the 11,930 protected areas in Russia, there are 102 state nature reserves and 52 national parks. There are 2 federal protected areas in the Vologda Region - the Darwin Biosphere Reserve and the Russian North National Park, and 199 protected areas of regional and local significance - sanctuaries, natural monuments and others.

        But one of the main problems of the protected areas system both in Russia and abroad is the actual lack of connectivity between protected areas. Each protected area is a small island that provides a more or less safe haven for its wild inhabitants. The real sustainability of natural systems can be achieved only by creating ecological corridors between protected areas.
        Not in all cases, the regime of special protection in the best possible way contributes to the preservation of natural complexes and the education of respect and curiosity in people towards them. In some cases, measures are needed to restore the initial or secondary functions of natural systems, such as in the drained peatlands of the Vologda region. The introduction of the principles of sustainable environmental management (agriculture, water use, forest management), for example, in areas adjacent to special protection zones, brings great social and environmental benefits.

        The autonomous non-profit organization "Northern Horizons" was established in May 2024 in the Vologda region. We do not limit our work to the Vologda Oblast and the region of the Russian North, but at the moment we give priority to this area. We would like to have local environmental public organizations in every region, or even in every administrative district, municipality. Just as the protection of natural systems needs an ecological framework, so public initiatives need a network of like-minded people. Positive examples of nature protection and successful implementation of nature-oriented solutions in the economy are best able to mutually motivate public activists, experts and administrative figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mission of "Northern Horizons":
        1) Comprehensively contribute to the emergence of new specially protected natural areas
        2) To increase and unlock the potential of existing protected areas through scientific research, student practices, expert congresses and consultations, improvement of management decisions in protected areas, formation of environmental squads and assets among local residents, development of environmental education
        3) To form ecological corridors and zones of sustainable nature management of various functional purposes between protected areas as an ecological framework
